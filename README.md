# Clicker002
Simple project- when you click button it adds one to overall score
Based on: https://youtu.be/0wrJA3mAcSo?list=WL

During upload to git repo i got into trouble (my computer wasn't connected to the same email as github account- I suppose).

If you have the following problem:

      Can't finish GitHub sharing process
			Successfully created project 'Clicker' on GitHub, but initial commit failed:
			*** Please tell me who you are.
			
			Run
			
			git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
			git config --global user.name "Your Name"
